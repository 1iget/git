## What is VFS for Git?

VFS stands for Virtual File System. VFS for Git virtualizes the file system beneath your git repo so that git and all tools
see what appears to be a normal repo, but VFS for Git only downloads objects as they are needed. VFS for Git also manages the files that git will consider,
to ensure that git operations like status, checkout, etc., can be as quick as possible because they will only consider the files
that the user has accessed, not all files in the repo.

## New name

This project was formerly known as GVFS (Git Virtual File System). It is undergoing a rename to VFS for Git. While the rename is in progress, the code, protocol,
built executables, and releases may still refer to the old GVFS name. See https://github.com/Microsoft/VFSForGit/projects/4 for the latest status of the rename effort.

## Installing VFS for Git

* VFS for Git requires Windows 10 Anniversary Update (Windows 10 version 1607) or later
* Run the latest GVFS and Git for Windows installers from https://github.com/Microsoft/VFSForGit/releases

## Building VFS for Git on Windows

If you'd like to build your own VFS for Git Windows installer:
* Install Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition or higher (https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).
  * Include the following workloads:
    * .NET desktop development
    * Desktop development with C++
    * .NET Core cross-platform development
  * Include the following additional components:
    * .NET Core runtime
    * C++/CLI support
    * Windows 10 SDK (10.0.10240.0)
* Install the .NET Core 2.1 SDK (https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1)
* Create a folder to clone into, e.g. `C:\Repos\VFSForGit`
* Clone this repo into the `src` subfolder, e.g. `C:\Repos\VFSForGit\src`
* Run `\src\Scripts\BuildGVFSForWindows.bat`
* You can also build in Visual Studio by opening `src\GVFS.sln` (do not upgrade any projects) and building. However, the very first
build will fail, and the second and subsequent builds will succeed. This is because the build requires a prebuild code generation step.
For details, see the build script in the previous step.

The installer can now be found at `C:\Repos\VFSForGit\BuildOutput\GVFS.Installer\bin\x64\[Debug|Release]\SetupGVFS.<version>.exe`

## Building VFS for Git on Mac

VFS for Git on Mac is still in progress. You can build it, but this will not create a macOS VFS installer the same way the current Windows build will.

* Ensure you have Xcode installed, have accepted the terms of use, and launched Xcode at least once.

* Disable the "System Integrity Protection" (for loading unsigned Kexts) by booting into recovery mode (`[Win/âŒ˜] + R` while booting).
  Once booted into recovery mode open Utilities -> Terminal to launch a termnial. Enter:
  ```
  csrutil disable
  ```
  to disable SIP. Then click the Apple logo in the top left and restart.

* Install [Visual Studio for Mac ](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac). (This will also install the `dotnet` CLI).

* If you still do not have the `dotnet` cli `>= v2.1.300` installed [manually install it]. You can check what version you have with `dotnet --version`.(https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1)

* You will need to manage and sign your own certificate. [Apple Developer Cert Docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/certificate_key_and_trust_services/certificates).

* Create a `VFS` directory and Clone VFSForGit into a directory called `src` inside it:
  ```
  mkdir VFS && cd VFS && git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/VFSForGit.git src && cd src
  ```

* From the src directory run

  ```
  Scripts/Mac/BuildGVFSForMac.sh [Release]
  ```

  _Troubleshooting if this fails_

  If you get
  ```
  xcodebuild: error: SDK "macosx10.13" cannot be located.
  ```
  You may have the "XCode Command Line Tools" installed (helpfully by Mac OS) instead of full XCode.
  Make sure
  ```
  xcode-select -p
  ```

  shows `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`. If it does not, install Xcode and then launch it (you can close it afterwards.)

* Prep your machine to use VFS for Git. The following are all done by the script below.wwwww
  * install Homebrew
  * install and setup the git credential manager (with `brew`)
  * install/update Java (with `brew`)
  * install a VFS for Git aware version of Git

  ```
  Scripts/Mac/PrepFunctionalTests.sh
  ```

* Now you have to load the ProjFS Kext.

  ```
  ProjFS.Mac/Scripts/LoadPrjFSKext.sh [Release]
  ```

* Add your built gvfs program to your path. A simple way to do that is by adding `Path/to/VFS/Publish` to your path.

  Confirm you have it by running

  ```
  command -v gvfs
  ```

  You should see a path to the gvfs executable.

* Try cloning a VFS for Git enabled repository!

  ```
  gvfs clone URL_TO_REPOSITORY --local-cache-path ~/.gvfsCache
  ```

  Note the current use of `--local-cache-path`. That argument prevents VFS for Git from running into a permissions error trying to put the cache at the root of your Mac's hard-drive because porting of this feature is still in progress.


## Trying out VFS for Git

* VFS for Git will work with any git service that supports the GVFS [protocol](Protocol.md). For example, you can create a repo in
Visual Studio Team Services (https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/), and push some contents to it. There are two constraints:
  * Your repo must not enable any clean/smudge filters
  * Your repo must have a `.gitattributes` file in the root that includes the line `* -text`
* `gvfs clone <URL of repo you just created>`
* `cd <root>\src`
* Run git commands as you normally would
* `gvfs unmount` when done


# Licenses

The VFS for Git source code in this repo is available under the MIT license. See [License.md](License.md).

VFS for Git relies on the PrjFlt filter driver, formerly known as the GvFlt filter driver, available as a prerelease NuGet package.
